          <p>Pop-Machina is a Horizon 2020 project that seeks to highlight and reinforce the links between the maker movement and circular economy in order to promote environmental sustainability and generate socio-economic benefits in European cities.</p>
          <p>In this website I will be posting all the progress that I make in the pop-machina academy.</p>

        <h1>Project 1: Making the logo</h1>
        <div class="entry">
          <p> In the following images you can see two versions of the logo that I have designed. The idea was to mix something that represents Santander with the concept of a space maker. Therefore, I have chosen to represent Santander as a wave because It
            is well known due to its beautiful bay. On the other hand, I have chosen a wrench, which is hidden inside the wave, to represent the space maker.
          </p>
          <p>The logo has been designed using the software Inkscape.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="separator"></div>
          <p>These are the steps that I have followed to make the logo:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>I have painted the wave using the tool "Pencil Tool": This allows you to creates freehand paths by drawing directly on the canvas.</li>
            <li>Once I've finished drawing the wave, I've used the tool "Node Tool" to manipulate the shape of the wave till I got the desired shape.</li>
            <li>I've written the text using the tool "Text Tool".</li>
            <li>After the wave and the text are finished, I've used a new layer to draw the wrench over the wave. To draw its shape I've repeated the steps 1 and 2.</li>
            <li>Finally, I've used the shortcut "ctrl+shift+R" to adjust the canvas to the size of the logo.</li>

        <h1>Session 2: Materials </h1>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>In this section I will summarize the talk Anastasia Pistofidou gave us during the session 3 of pop-machina academy.</p>
          <p>She talked about the use of sustainable materials, rather than using non-biodegradable materials, to make all kind of items. It is said that many of the materials used on daily basis are recyclabe, altough sometimes those elements find a path
            to recycle themselves, often they do not have a recovery path. An example of this kind of materials is PLA plastics which are used in 3d printig.</p>

          <p>Currently, pollution is a serious problem and it will be more serious in the future. Therefore, humanity should raise awareness about the use of biodegradable materials during desinging process such as foodwaste to make bioplastic. This, can
            be made with a lot of different materials such gelatine, agar, etc. </p>

          <p>I think that a good idea for a space maker could be to do a whorkshop where people design and make their own bioplastic clothes. I think that this kind of whorkshop would create awareness about the reuse of wasted materials to make things that
            could not probably imagine possible.</p>

        <h1>Session 3: Communities</h1>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>In this session Marion Real, who is a systemic design researcher, explained the different steps to to start a maker project. Some of these are:</p>
          <ol class="entry-ol">
            <li>
              <p>Define the idea of the project</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Who is the project aimed at?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>What resourses are needed to do the project?</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Engage local stakeholders such as neighborhood associations, restaurants, local business, etc. One thing that is really important about this is to keep the stakeholders committed to the project. Therefore, to achieve this, communication
                is crucial.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Marion also explained the program "Remix El Barrio" where participants are synergizing and co-developing materials, products and services from local food waste.</p>

          <p>In regards to the definition of a maker community, I think that a maker community are a group of people whose main insterest is to design and create new products by <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>
