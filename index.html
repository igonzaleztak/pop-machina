          <p>In this entry, I'm going to explain the design of the website. This is a simple static web page that was made using only HTML and CSS. These were used to define the structure of the page and its style respectively.</p>

          <p>The style of the page was made using bootstrap 4. For instance, the vertical navigation bar that appears on the left of the wbesite, was designed by modifying the class <i>vertical-nav bg-white</i> of this package.</p>

        <div class="entry">
          <p> In the following images you can see two versions of the logo that I have designed. The idea was to mix something that represents Santander with the concept of a space maker. Therefore, I have chosen to represent Santander as a wave because It
            is well known due to its beautiful bay. On the other hand, I have chosen a wrench, which is hidden inside the wave, to represent the space maker.
          </p>
          <p>The logo has been designed using the software Inkscape.</p>

          <div class="separator"></div>
          <p>These are the steps that I have followed to make the logo:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>I have painted the wave using the tool "Pencil Tool": This allows you to creates freehand paths by drawing directly on the canvas.</li>
            <li>Once I've finished drawing the wave, I've used the tool "Node Tool" to manipulate the shape of the wave till I got the desired shape.</li>
            <li>I've written the text using the tool "Text Tool".</li>
            <li>After the wave and the text are finished, I've used a new layer to draw the wrench over the wave. To draw its shape I've repeated the steps 1 and 2.</li>
            <li>Finally, I've used the shortcut "ctrl+shift+R" to adjust the canvas to the size of the logo.</li>

        <h1>Session 3: Materials </h1>
        <div class="entry">
          <p>In this section I will summarize the talk Anastasia Pistofidou gave us during the session 3 of pop-machina academy.</p>
          <p>She talked about the use of sustainable materials, rather than using non-biodegradable materials, to make all kind of items. It is said that many of the materials used on daily basis are recyclabe, altough sometimes those elements find a path
            to recycle themselves, often they do not have a recovery path. An example of this kind of materials is PLA plastics which are used in 3d printig.</p>

          <p>Currently, pollution is a serious problem and it will be more serious in the future. Therefore, humanity should raise awareness about the use of biodegradable materials during desinging process such as foodwaste to make bioplastic. This, can
            be made with a lot of different materials such gelatine, agar, etc. </p>

          <p>I think that a good idea for a space maker could be to do a whorkshop where people design and make their own bioplastic clothes. I think that this kind of whorkshop would create awareness about the reuse of wasted materials to make things that
            could not probably imagine possible.</p>

        <div class="entry">
          <p>In this session Marion Real, who is a systemic design researcher, explained the different steps to to start a maker project. Some of these are:</p>
          <ol class="entry-ol">
            <li>
              <p>Define the idea of the project</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Who is the project aimed at?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>What resourses are needed to do the project?</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Engage local stakeholders such as neighborhood associations, restaurants, local business, etc. One thing that is really important about this is to keep the stakeholders committed to the project. Therefore, to achieve this, communication
                is crucial.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Marion also explained the program "Remix El Barrio" where participants are synergizing and co-developing materials, products and services from local food waste.</p>

          <p>In regards to the definition of a maker community, I think that a maker community are a group of people whose main insterest is to design and create new products by <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>

            <p>In this session, Katharina Elleke came to the pop-machina academy to explain the use of used plastic to develop new products.</p>

            <p>I really think that having equipment for plastic recyling in the maker space can engage a lot of people. We waste a lot of plastic every day, so I think that it might be useful to show a way to reuse that trash.</p>

            <p>The only problem that I see is that all the plastic has to be of the same type so that it can be recycled. I don't know whether sorting the plastic is an easy task or not.</p>

            <h1>Session 6: Being a Lab Manager</h1>
            <div class="entry">
              <p>In this session Mikel Llobera and Josep Martí told us the different considerations that fablab managers should have when buying the machines of the maker space. They have to take in considerations a lot of stuff such. For instance, the difficulty
                of the machines to have more or less people in the lab. </p>

              <p>I've never been into a Fablab, so I don't know exactly how is the day to day in these kind of places. I suppose that a Fablab manager should be able to cooperate with the people, help them and teach themto achieve their goals. Moreover,
                I think that a Fablab manager should be able to coordinate the time that people spend in the machines so everybody can use them when they are needed. I also think that the most important thing that the manager of a Fablab should do is
                to foster the people to achieve their goals. People have to believe that they can make anything with hard work.</p>

                <p>In this session Eduardo Chamorro talked to us about the 3D printing. He showed us the different materials and techniques that can be used to create new things using 3D printers.</p>
                <p>I really liked the talk that Eduardo gave us. I have always been curious to know how this type of machines work and if they are cheap to buy and mantain.</p>

                <p>Regarding the learning that might be useful in a maker space, I think that is important to know which are the materials that should be used and which method of 3D printing is easiest to learn so everybody can use the machine.</p>

                <h1>Session 8: Collecting data for social innovation</h1>
                <div class="entry">
                  <p>In this session, we used App inventor to create a simple Android app that sends data from the mobile phone to a remote server. In this case, the mobile phone acts as sensor that measures the level of the sound.</p>

                  <p>First, I would like to say that I really enjoyed this session. However, I do not have an Android phone so I had to do all the session using Appinventor’s android emulator (option 3 on the website <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup">https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup</a>).</p>


                  <p>After installing the emulator, I just connected it with the <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/#6376374166487040">MIT App Inventor</a> using the button connect to emulator.</p>

                  <p>Once the emulator was connected to the app inventor website, we added the different extensions that we were going to use during the session. Specifically, we used two extensions: One to measure the level of the sound and another one
                    to establish a MQTT connection with the IAAC remote server. </p>

                  <p>During this session, I encountered some problems with the Android emulator. Every time I tried to execute the app that we created using the app inventor, it failed to execute it. I do not know if the problem was the emulator in particular
                    or the browser where I was running the app inventor. I will try to do it on a real Android phone in the future (this weekend, I hope). Despite the problems that I encountered, I was able to run an application that showed some text
                    on the screen of the emulator, but not the that sent the sound level of the environment to the IAAC server. In the following figure, you can see the app created by the app inventor in the Android emulator screen:</p>
